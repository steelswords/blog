Here are some of the books I read in 2023 and what I thought of them.

# *The Hail Mary Project* by Andy Weir

11/10. This was such a fun read! Good sci-fi, technical enough to keep me entertained,
and yet not so technical as to bore the non-STEM. Such a good read, I cannot recommend
this book enough. One of my top picks for 2023!


# *Needful Things* by Stephen King

10/10. Excellently Written. A gripping premise. The book draws you along from high
excitement to high excitement. A good read for horror fans.


# *Educated: A Memoir* by Tara Westover

10/10. This book is an Important Book to Read. An excellent tail.


# *Bad Blood: Secrets and Lies in a Silicon Valley Startup* by John Carreyrou

7/10. This was a good account of the Theranos scandel. Makes you shake your head at
Elizabeth Holmes.


# *Steve Jobs* by Walter Isaacson

9/10. An excellent biography. Isaacson made me appreciate Jobs in a more complex, nuanced
way, which I'm sure we all deserve. It also cemented my exacerbation of those who
idolize Jobs. There are so many similarities between Jobs and Elon Musk. The absolute
certainty that these men have of their own rightness and the way those around them
have to work around them, not with them, to accomplish anything. I hope I never
become one of these billionaires living in their own self-deluded bubble.


# *Stuff Matters: Exploring the Marvelous Materials That Shape Our Man-Made World* by Mark Miodownik

8/10. An excellent little book on material science. I particularly loved the descriptions
of porcelain and self-healing concrete.


# *The Final Empire* by Brandon Sanderson
10/10. This was such a lovely fantasy read. People have been telling me for ages that I
should read Mistborn, so I was glad to see what all the fuss was about. The story
wrapped up so nicely that I honestly didn't want to start the sequel.


# *Chip War: The Quest to Dominate the World's Most Critical Technology* by Chris Miller
7/10. An interesting history of the semiconductor industry.


# *Blade Runner* by Phillip K. Dick

8/10. A classic scifi/film noir. Not much to say. Was it worth reading? Probably. I think
the synthetics/natural born angle is better explored in other franchises, though.
*Battlestar Galactica* being one.


# *The Seven Habits of Highly Effective People* by Stephen R. Covey
11/10. I highly recommend this book to everyone. The breadth and depth of practical
prescriptions for life and character refinement are impeccable. This book drops so
many truth bombs and then just keeps them coming. Nonfiction Book of the Year award
from me!


# *The Well of Ascention* by Brandon Sanderson.
8/10. This book flags a little behind its predecessor. But it is still a great novel.
Again, the ending made me not want to read ahead, which I am forced to conclude, is
a regular effect of Sanderson's writting. There were high payoff moments, though,
and much appreciated expansion on some topics introduced in *The Final Empire*.
Eventually I will read the third book in the series, but I'm still recovering from
the end of this one.


# *When McKinsey Comes to Town* by Walt Bogdanich and Michael Forsythe

8/10. An eye-opening tale of corporate greed and corruption. Everyone should read
this book if they wish to understand corporate America better.


# *Just Mercy: A Story of Justice and Redemption* by Bryan Stevenson

10/10. Everyone should read this book too. The author's background in philosophy
certainly comes through in his measured, gentle prose on a charged and fraught topic.
Such a valuable work in both race relations and criminal justice, from a man on the
inside.


# *Speaker for the Dead* by Orson Scott Card

9/10. This was a really smashing read. I was entralled with the Piggies and their culture,
and the narrative was engaging. I was left craving the next book.


# *Ghost in the Wires: My Adventures as the World's Most Wanted Hacker* by Kevin Mitnik
10/10. This was a phenominal read. I'd read Kevin Mitnik's other book, *The Art
of Deception*, before and enjoyed it. This was like on a whole 'nother level. Fans
of *Mr. Robot* and *Catch Me If You Can* will love this book as well!!
