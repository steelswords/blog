Here are some of the books I read in 2025 and what I thought of them.

# *The Communist Manifesto* by Karl Marx and Fredrich Engels

This... was interesting. I may have to publish some more detailed thoughts on
the topic of communism another time. *The Communist Manifesto* begins with a lot
of points I agree with: the oppression of the proletariat by the bourgeoisie,
the necessity of seeking capital to force others to a lower status, and the
oppression inherent in a capitalist system. However, the quality of arguments does
seem to devolve a bit near the end.

# *For We Are Many* by Dennis E. Taylor
Another great Bobiverse book. 10/10.

# *The Maze Runner* by James Dashner
I remember the cool kids in my eighth grade class honors reading/newspaper class
being super into this series, so of course I eschewed this series at the time,
because if *those guys* liked it, how could it possibly be good? Ah, the follies
of youth.

This is a 9/10 book. I would rate it 10/10 except it is simply frustrating to read,
especially at the beginning. Not because the writing is bad, mind you. In fact, I
think Dashner's prose captures the thought patterns of an adolescent boy marvellously.
No, I was frustrated reading this book at times because it poses many more questions
than it actually answers. The first ten (short) chapters make you ask more and more
questions, with the only answers given to the protagonist being "Shut up and you'll
find out, noob."

Some things in the mystery of the Maze I figured out before the official explanation
was given in the narrative (allow me to pat myself on the back for being quicker
on the uptake than a literal teenager, heh heh). But there were still plenty of
times that *Maze Runner* surprised and shocked me, even to the point of audible
gasps!

This book left a lot of things unanswered, and I'll admit that I was a little annoyed
I might have to read -- what? seven more books to get the answers I crave now!
It's an exercise in trust in the author to invest eight books' worth of time in
his works to get a satisfying narrative resolution. But trust I shall, because
for all the narrative checks Dashner writes, he hasn't bounced any yet. Looking
forward to the series being finished off before I get to the end.

# *The Scorch Trials* by James Dashner

This is the second book in *The Maze Runner* series. 10/10.
{% spoilersection(caption="Show Scorch Trials Spoilers") %}
I feel like the "escape from a box with seemingly no exit" angle was really the
icing on the cake in *Maze Runner*. While *Scorch Trials* lacked that element,
it more than made up for it in sheer "What the heck?!" moments. Holy cow, the
twists! Very good.

# *The Death Cure* by James Dashner

The third book in *The Mazer Runner* series. 9/10. It's been a while between
finishing this book and writing this review, but I seem to recall there were
some plot choices that seemed to weaken parts of the narrative that happened
previously. However, the ending was a fairly satisfying payoff. I if I finished
on a different day I would have balked at the rapid conclusion, though.

# *All These Worlds* by Dennis E. Taylor
10/10. What can I say except the Bobiverse is one of my favorite series now?
My goodness, another solid installation. Every book of Mr. Taylor's I have read
thus far has been consistently top-notch.

# *A Man Called Ove* by Fredrick Backman
10/10. This is a wonderful book. It's one of stories that makes you hate a guy,
then love him. I was floored really early on. This is a wonderful tale about
communiy, heartbreak, taking *responsibility*, and human kindness.

# *Heaven's River* by Dennis E. Taylor
10/10. What more is there to say? Another Bobiverse book. Another fantasitc,
nerdy novel in what has quickly become my favorite Sci-fi series. Just start at
the beginning and read all these books. That's all I have to say on the subject.

# *Russia in Revolution* by S. A. Smith
I've been reading a lot of literature on communism (not all of it finished, and
not all of it mentioned here), and so I needed to have some legitimate
historical context to the Soviet state. This provided that. It was dry in some
parts, but what serious historical work isn't? 8/10.
