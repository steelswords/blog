Here are some of the books I read in 2024 and what I thought of them.

# *The Silmarillion* by J.R.R. and Christopher Tolkien

10/10. This was my third attempt to read *The Silmarillion*, and I honestly think
it took me a minor in Classics (Latin) to appreciate the mythology aspect. But
my goodness, it was a beautiful read. Typical of Tolkien, everything weaves together
so beautifully.

# *Legacy of Ashes* by Tim Weiner
9/10. This history of the CIA was eye-opening, to say the least. The fact that
the CIA was not able to provide one single early warning during the Korean War,
the constant infiltration of CIA by Soviet spies during the Cold War, its own
inability to compromise anyone in the Kremlin, the anti-democratic actions taken
in other countries "to stop the Commies...", the spying on left-wing Americans
for the same reason, the Iran-Contra affair, The list goes on and on, and made me
ashamed of my country, to be frank.

This is a contender for my list of Books Every American Should Read for that very
reason. It is so important for us to confront uncomfortable truths and process them
so we can improve as a nation.

# *The Secret Language of Cells* by Jon Lieff

7/10. This was an okay book. To be honest, I was looking for something that would
give me a bit more technical detail when it came to cellular signalling, but alas,
as so many books are, this was more on the pop-sci side of the spectrum. It still
taught me a good many new things about how cells communicate, and how widespread
that communication is across the body.

# *The Whole-Brain Child* by Drs. Daniel J. Siegel and Tina Payne Bryson
8/10. This book was geared more towards older children, say 6 years and older,
but the principles seem sound even for my younger child. The authors are both
qualified to write on brain-based parenting, being a
[well-published academic psychiatrist](https://drdansiegel.com/curriculum-vitae/)
and a [practicing psychotherapist](https://www.tinabryson.com/about-tina-bryson).

It is incredibly hard to causally blame or credit a child's behavior to anything
in particular, which is part of what makes getting solid, evidence-based parenting
advice so hard in today's world chock full of grifters. But I will add my anecdotal
testimony that in my (clearly) biased opinion, my child's behavior is exceptionally
well-adjusted for their age, and I do tend to apply many of the theory and practices
from *The Whole-Brain Child* in my parenting, and encourage my wife to do the same.

# *Snow Crash* by Neal Stephenson
This was one of Stephenson's earlier works, if I'm not mistaken. The first chapter
was phenomenal! It had me on the edge of my seat: it was engaging, rapid-paced,
humorous, just enough farce to be amusing, but not so much to break the suspension
of disbelief. And then the pacing kind of petered out. The rest of the book got
kind of slow. And repetitive. And a little bit boring. 6/10.

# *Midnight in Chernobyl* by Adam Higginbotham
A great history of the Chernobyl disaster. 10/10. I was stunned to learn that the
adverse health effects of radiation on the affected population of Pripyat were
far outpaced by the mental effects of being invisibly poisoned. That was
fascinating! And it helped ease some of my concerns about nuclear power potentially
making a comeback.

(In general, I am pragmatic about nuclear power. I know reactor
designs have become much, much safer since Three Mile Island, Chernobyl, and
Fukishima. I am overall in favor of more nuclear power, since it provides a lot
of power with no direct CO2 emissions. I just have safety concerns, that's all.)

# *The Hero of Ages* by Brandon Sanderson

9/10.
The conclusion of the original *Mistborn* series. I would say overall I prefer
the first book over the other two, this book was satisfactory and I quite enjoyed
it. It wrapped up very nicely at the end in a way that surprised me, so kudos to
Mr. Sanderson.


# *Inkheart* by Cornelia Funke
5/10. Oh my word. This book was such a flip-flop for me. It has such pacing problems.
And I suspect it suffers from translation problems too. First, the name of the Big
Bad Evil Guy: *Capricorn???* The name gives idyllic goat, or possibly a goatherd,
not a psychopathic villain.

{% spoilersection(caption="Show Inkheart Spoilers") %}

There are scenes that go on for pages and pages that add nothing to the story.
The action starts to pick up, and then immediately we take a break for a good 50
pages. Then when you think it's going to pick up again, it does, but only at a
glacial pace. Where was Funke's editor? Really this book would have been good
if it lost a solid third of its page count.

It does do great justice to the whole book-lover culture and aesthetic, I will
give it that.

The characters feel somewhat flat as well. The best fleshed-out characters seem
to be those read out of a book.

And then there are so many questions left unanswered at the end. Why on *Earth*
was Basta still here? Why didn't he go back? Why was Fenoglio able to write
the Little Tin Soldier back into his story, but not Basta, or all the other
humans and fairy-tale creatures he resurrected? Why do they not get to go back
to the story? Why did they not try to get Teresa back into the story, and then
back to the real world again so she could speak?

Also, Dustfinger just sucks. Man, what an awful guy! If I were an English teacher
teaching characterization, I would happily entertain student essays on how
Dustfinger is the true villain of the piece.

# *We Are Legion, We Are Bob* by Dennis E. Taylor
9/10. This is such a fun book! It's right up there with *Project Hail Mary* by
Andy Weir in my eyes. Lots of nerdy fun, especially amusing for engineering types
who just relate so easily to Bob.

{% spoilersection(caption="Show We are Legion, We Are Bob Spoilers") %}
The audiobook got a little confusing to follow once Bob buds off new Bobs, but
you get used to it fairly quickly. That's why it's not 10/10.

# *Never a Girl, Always a Boy: A Family Memoir of a Transgender Journey* by Jo Ivester

9/10.
This was an interesting read. There is a lot about the trans experience I would
like to understand, so I'm glad I got to read Jeremy Ivester's story of
transition. This is a collection of scenes told from the points of view of different
members of the Ivester family as Jeremy (n√©e Emily) grew up and reckoned with
his gender dysphoria, eventually coming to live as a man.

The last section of the book does seem a little self-congratulatory on
account of the author's deep dive into her activism, and earlier segments in the
book give the impression that the mother (who collected and wrote this memoir)
really just wanted to process her thoughts in a book. I knocked a point off for
those writing choices.

# *The Dispatcher* by John Scalzi
8/10. This was a short one, but an interesting concept. Definitely worth the two
hour listen. The writing was a little unpolished in places, and there were some
big questions left unanswered, but overall it was an enjoyable scifi story.

# *The Nazis* by Lauence Rees
I picked this book up in November. Something about that current events made me
want to research  the rise of the Nazi regime, I forget specifically what....
Imagine my grimly brief shock to learn that many associated with the Nazi party
still to this day (or at least the day of Rees interviewing them) stand by their
actions as seeming to be the right thing at the time. Yep.

This was a fairly good account of the rise of Nazism in Germany, followed by a
decent account of WWII as related to the Third Reich, followed by a bizarre
tangent into the Soviet experience of WWII, and concluded with more Nazi history.

8/10 for the lengthy diversion into Soviet history.

# *Change: How to Make Big Things Happen* by Damon Centola
10/10. This is a great book on how challenging ideas spread through a social
network. It was eye-opening, fascinating, and full of research that challenged
my preconceived notions, most of which was done by the author. I highly recommend
anyone who wishes to know more about how change happens in a people, how and why
some ideas take hold and others don't, read this book front to back.

# *Beyond Lies the Wub*
7/10. An okay short story.


# *Pigs is Pigs*
10/10. Hilarious satire. A worthwhile short story if there ever was one.

# *Verification Handbook* ed. Craig Silverman
This book explains a lot.

It is meant as a handbook to educate journalists on best practices for verifying
sources, especially as an emergency breaks. It is filled with such mind-numbingly
basic advice on verifying information on social media that I wish I hadn't spent
the time to read it. Advice like, "Cultivate a network of trustworthy people" and
"Verify facts with a quick Google search before spreading them" is like giving
someone pointers on brushing their teeth like, "If your toothbrush ends up buried
four inches up your nostril, you're doing it wrong."

If this is the state of the art of verifying sources, it is no wonder journalists
are so often bamboozled, misinformed, and outright deceived with frightening
regularity. 2/10.

# *Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows* by J.K. Rowling
I believe I reread this early in the year, when my wife and I were playing Hogwarts
Legacy around the clock. It was a wonderful, heart wrenching jaunt into one of
my favorite childhood series.

# *Eleanor Oliphant is Completely Fine* by Gail Honeyman
10/10. One of my favorite books of the year. The unreliable narrator, the Classics
minor, the despair which then has delightful developments at the start. This is
easily one of my Top Books of 2024.

# *Focus* by Daniel Goleman
I don't remember much about this book. That says a lot about its content, eh?
I do recall that a nontrivial amount of its content seemed obvious or repetitive.

# *Atomic Habits* by James Clear
I believe this was lampooned on the
[If Books Could Kill](https://www.patreon.com/IfBooksPod) podcast (which I
highly recommend). The book itself had some interesting ideas, like deconstructing
the habits you want to acquire and incorporating those smaller steps into your
life instead of the whole habit all at once. By and large, however, *Atomic Habits*,
as with most self-improvement books, could have been reduced to a blog post. Clear
drones on and on, flailing to flesh out the one or two things he has to say into
a work long enough to publish as a book.

3/10. Not really worth the read, but if you're bored at your grandparents' house....

# *Paved Paradise* by Henry Grabar
10/10. An Important Book to Read. Grabar goes into detail about how parking
requirements are at the heart of a whole slew of urban ills plaguing America:
suburban sprawl, lack of public transportation, traffic congestion, unwalkable
communities. This is a must-read for anyone interested in any of those issues.

# *The Age of Surveillance Capitalism* by Shoshana Zuboff
8/10. This book really does drone on, and arguably should be a lot shorter, but
its content is so important that I can't in good conscience knock it below an
8/10. Shoshana, who, I believe, coined the term *Surveillance Capitalism*,
details the lengths to which Big Tech companies mine us for the newest exploitable
resource: our behavioral data. I wish all could come up to date with this topic,
as data collection is so pervasive, and those who are least educated on it are
exploited the most.
