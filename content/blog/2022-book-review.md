Here are some of the books I read in 2022 and what I thought of them.

# *The Mythical Man Month* by Fred Brooks

10/10. *The Mythical Man Month* is a classic of software program management, and
for good reason. Every chapter laid out truths about software development that
resonated deeply with my experience. There were some surreal parts of some of 
the later chapters where Brooks would go from a timeless nugget of wisdom to 
discussing details of the microfiche system he was using. However, I’d say 93% 
of the book is just as relevant today as it was then. For a 1975 computer book, 
The Mythical Man Month holds up impressively well.


# *Dune* by Frank Herbert

7/10. I’ll admit, I started reading Dune because of the 2021 film. I started reading it in that year and only in 2022 did I finish it. This book is dense. The world building is impeccable. It can be a little tedious at times because you get to experience scenes through multiple characters’ eyes. I want to know what’s going to happen to Muad’Dib, but for now this series is on the back burner.


# *Ready Player Two* by Ernest Cline

3/10. I’m sad to say this did not live to its predecessor. I think it’s a combination of factors. Most of the references did not resonate with me, and the pacing was wonky. The setup was cool, but took a long time. Then the first couple adventures took a long time, followed by several rushed ones and a quick ending.

# *The Green Mile* by Stephen King

7/10. Good writing. Mostly interesting story. Not as captivating as Misery. There were some dull spots. But it did make me cry, so there’s that.

# *Shady Characters* by Keith Houston

9/10. I would recommend this book to anyone who has ever wondered why the question mark looks the way it does, or anyone who knows what a pilcrow is. Very informative and well researched.

# *Evicted* by Nathan Desmond

10/10. It is hard to express how meaningful this book was to read. It takes a very honest look at poverty in America, revolving around evictions and housing insecurity. This was written by a man who has spent years with poor tenants and their landlords. This is one of those books that will change your outlook on things forever. I very much recommend it.

# *The Body: A Guide for Occupants* by Bill Bryson

7/10. This book was good, but felt a little offbeat at times. My main takeaways are these. First, medicine has really only had a handful of really big hits: germ theory, a scientific understanding of anatomy, antibiotics, anesthetic, and vaccines. There is still a lot we don’t know about the body. But ol’ Bill Bryson does not have a medical degree, so if anyone qualified would like to email me to correct my takeaways, I would welcome it.

The other takeaway from The Body is an understanding of why traditional, conservative farming communities are predisposed to be leery of doctors. Because until about 120 years ago, a lot of what doctors did was actively harmful. Yikes!

# *How to Invent Everything: A Survival Guide for the Stranded Time Traveler* by Ryan North

10/10. I love this book. I have always tried to build a library where if it were the last remaining library on Earth, I could feasibly rebuild civilization. You know, at least a bit. This book is now the crown jewel of that collection. It was amazing to see how to bootstrap civilization in one hardcover tome. If I ever have to dash off into the wilderness, I hope to have a copy of How to Invent Everything with me.
