# About Me

I love making things work.

I am an embedded engineer living in the Salt Lake Metro area, Utah, USA. I love Linux, embedded systems, and computer security. I also love acting, singing, and playing the piano. And learning languages, like Latin and Chinese. Most of all, though, I love creating things.

# Experience

I have been working professionally as an engineer since January of 2018. Most of that time has been spent working with drones: everything from developing software to fly autonomous missions to designing circuit boards to working on the frame. Since then, I have shifted to working in the home security and IoT space. I have a B.S. in computer engineering from Utah State University.

# Why engineering?

As a kid, I loved the Harry Potter books. I used to dream about waking up to an invitation to learn about a world of magic.

Electronics and computers are the closest thing to magic we have in this world. Tell me this isn't magic: We melt down a lump of sand into a very specific configuration. By doing special, wizardly things to it, we can package that lump of melted sand into something you can speak to and it can literally order a pizza for you. That lump of sand uses wizardry to understand what you’re saying, talks to other lumps of sand through wires people have strung every which way, and eventually another lump of sand writes a message to a human being, who starts making you a pizza. This is magic, my friends, and I am all in.

# Things you should know about me

- I’m a self-starter. I taught myself to code in middle school and Latin in high school. I love learning!
- I constantly have projects going on, from my chain mail, to learning to play the organ, to the operating system I started from scratch.
- I almost became an actor moonlighting as an engineer. I’m glad I’m doing it the other way around.
- I have watched Frasier probably upwards of 20 times through.
- I love Linux. It is the only operating system I use on the daily. No joke: every computer I own has Linux (or Android) installed on it.

# Examples of my work

If you’re an employer looking to give me a great job, you might be interested to see examples of my work on GitHub. A lot of my portfolio is school assignments and to make it harder for would-be plagiarists I have made all those repositories private. If you convince me you’re not just a lazy engineering student I’ll give you read access to the repositories for any of the following classes:

    Microcontrollers
    Computer Networks
    Compiler Construction
    Reconfigurable Computing
    Intelligent Systems
    Operating Systems and Concurrency
    Data Structures and Algorithms (C++)

Although I am still relatively new at engineering professionally, I am so excited to start my full-time engineering adventure! I love doing this stuff on my own and at work.
