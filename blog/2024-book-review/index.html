This was my third attempt to read <em>The Silmarillion</em>, and I honestly think it took me a minor in Classics (Latin) to appreciate the mythology aspect. But my goodness, it was a beautiful read. Typical of Tolkien, everything weaves together so beautifully.<h1 id=legacy-of-ashes-by-tim-weiner><a aria-label="Anchor link for: legacy-of-ashes-by-tim-weiner" class="header-anchor no-hover-padding" href=#legacy-of-ashes-by-tim-weiner><span aria-hidden=true class=link-icon></span></a> <em>Legacy of Ashes</em> by Tim Weiner</h1><p>9/10. This history of the CIA was eye-opening, to say the least. The fact that the CIA was not able to provide one single early warning during the Korean War, the constant infiltration of CIA by Soviet spies during the Cold War, its own inability to compromise anyone in the Kremlin, the anti-democratic actions taken in other countries "to stop the Commies...", the spying on left-wing Americans for the same reason, the Iran-Contra affair, The list goes on and on, and made me ashamed of my country, to be frank.<p>This is a contender for my list of Books Every American Should Read for that very reason. It is so important for us to confront uncomfortable truths and process them so we can improve as a nation.<h1 id=the-secret-language-of-cells-by-jon-lieff><a aria-label="Anchor link for: the-secret-language-of-cells-by-jon-lieff" class="header-anchor no-hover-padding" href=#the-secret-language-of-cells-by-jon-lieff><span aria-hidden=true class=link-icon></span></a> <em>The Secret Language of Cells</em> by Jon Lieff</h1><p>7/10. This was an okay book. To be honest, I was looking for something that would give me a bit more technical detail when it came to cellular signalling, but alas, as so many books are, this was more on the pop-sci side of the spectrum. It still taught me a good many new things about how cells communicate, and how widespread that communication is across the body.<h1 id=the-whole-brain-child-by-drs-daniel-j-siegel-and-tina-payne-bryson><a aria-label="Anchor link for: the-whole-brain-child-by-drs-daniel-j-siegel-and-tina-payne-bryson" class="header-anchor no-hover-padding" href=#the-whole-brain-child-by-drs-daniel-j-siegel-and-tina-payne-bryson><span aria-hidden=true class=link-icon></span></a> <em>The Whole-Brain Child</em> by Drs. Daniel J. Siegel and Tina Payne Bryson</h1><p>8/10. This book was geared more towards older children, say 6 years and older, but the principles seem sound even for my younger child. The authors are both qualified to write on brain-based parenting, being a <a href=https://drdansiegel.com/curriculum-vitae/ rel=noopener target=_blank>well-published academic psychiatrist</a> and a <a href=https://www.tinabryson.com/about-tina-bryson rel=noopener target=_blank>practicing psychotherapist</a>.<p>It is incredibly hard to causally blame or credit a child's behavior to anything in particular, which is part of what makes getting solid, evidence-based parenting advice so hard in today's world chock full of grifters. But I will add my anecdotal testimony that in my (clearly) biased opinion, my child's behavior is exceptionally well-adjusted for their age, and I do tend to apply many of the theory and practices from <em>The Whole-Brain Child</em> in my parenting, and encourage my wife to do the same.<h1 id=snow-crash-by-neal-stephenson><a aria-label="Anchor link for: snow-crash-by-neal-stephenson" class="header-anchor no-hover-padding" href=#snow-crash-by-neal-stephenson><span aria-hidden=true class=link-icon></span></a> <em>Snow Crash</em> by Neal Stephenson</h1><p>This was one of Stephenson's earlier works, if I'm not mistaken. The first chapter was phenomenal! It had me on the edge of my seat: it was engaging, rapid-paced, humorous, just enough farce to be amusing, but not so much to break the suspension of disbelief. And then the pacing kind of petered out. The rest of the book got kind of slow. And repetitive. And a little bit boring. 6/10.<h1 id=midnight-in-chernobyl-by-adam-higginbotham><a aria-label="Anchor link for: midnight-in-chernobyl-by-adam-higginbotham" class="header-anchor no-hover-padding" href=#midnight-in-chernobyl-by-adam-higginbotham><span aria-hidden=true class=link-icon></span></a> <em>Midnight in Chernobyl</em> by Adam Higginbotham</h1><p>A great history of the Chernobyl disaster. 10/10. I was stunned to learn that the adverse health effects of radiation on the affected population of Pripyat were far outpaced by the mental effects of being invisibly poisoned. That was fascinating! And it helped ease some of my concerns about nuclear power potentially making a comeback.<p>(In general, I am pragmatic about nuclear power. I know reactor designs have become much, much safer since Three Mile Island, Chernobyl, and Fukishima. I am overall in favor of more nuclear power, since it provides a lot of power with no direct CO2 emissions. I just have safety concerns, that's all.)<h1 id=the-hero-of-ages-by-brandon-sanderson><a aria-label="Anchor link for: the-hero-of-ages-by-brandon-sanderson" class="header-anchor no-hover-padding" href=#the-hero-of-ages-by-brandon-sanderson><span aria-hidden=true class=link-icon></span></a> <em>The Hero of Ages</em> by Brandon Sanderson</h1><p>9/10. The conclusion of the original <em>Mistborn</em> series. I would say overall I prefer the first book over the other two, this book was satisfactory and I quite enjoyed it. It wrapped up very nicely at the end in a way that surprised me, so kudos to Mr. Sanderson.<h1 id=inkheart-by-cornelia-funke><a aria-label="Anchor link for: inkheart-by-cornelia-funke" class="header-anchor no-hover-padding" href=#inkheart-by-cornelia-funke><span aria-hidden=true class=link-icon></span></a> <em>Inkheart</em> by Cornelia Funke</h1><p>5/10. Oh my word. This book was such a flip-flop for me. It has such pacing problems. And I suspect it suffers from translation problems too. First, the name of the Big Bad Evil Guy: <em>Capricorn???</em> The name gives idyllic goat, or possibly a goatherd, not a psychopathic villain.<div class=spoiler-section><button class=spoiler-toggle-button>Show Inkheart Spoilers</button><div class=spoiler-section-content><p>There are scenes that go on for pages and pages that add nothing to the story. The action starts to pick up, and then immediately we take a break for a good 50 pages. Then when you think it's going to pick up again, it does, but only at a glacial pace. Where was Funke's editor? Really this book would have been good if it lost a solid third of its page count.<p>It does do great justice to the whole book-lover culture and aesthetic, I will give it that.<p>The characters feel somewhat flat as well. The best fleshed-out characters seem to be those read out of a book.<p>And then there are so many questions left unanswered at the end. Why on <em>Earth</em> was Basta still here? Why didn't he go back? Why was Fenoglio able to write the Little Tin Soldier back into his story, but not Basta, or all the other humans and fairy-tale creatures he resurrected? Why do they not get to go back to the story? Why did they not try to get Teresa back into the story, and then back to the real world again so she could speak?<p>Also, Dustfinger just sucks. Man, what an awful guy! If I were an English teacher teaching characterization, I would happily entertain student essays on how Dustfinger is the true villain of the piece.</div></div><h1 id=we-are-legion-we-are-bob-by-dennis-e-taylor><a aria-label="Anchor link for: we-are-legion-we-are-bob-by-dennis-e-taylor" class="header-anchor no-hover-padding" href=#we-are-legion-we-are-bob-by-dennis-e-taylor><span aria-hidden=true class=link-icon></span></a> <em>We Are Legion, We Are Bob</em> by Dennis E. Taylor</h1><p>9/10. This is such a fun book! It's right up there with <em>Project Hail Mary</em> by Andy Weir in my eyes. Lots of nerdy fun, especially amusing for engineering types who just relate so easily to Bob.<div class=spoiler-section><button class=spoiler-toggle-button>Show We are Legion, We Are Bob Spoilers</button><div class=spoiler-section-content><p>The audiobook got a little confusing to follow once Bob buds off new Bobs, but you get used to it fairly quickly. That's why it's not 10/10.</div></div><h1 id=never-a-girl-always-a-boy-a-family-memoir-of-a-transgender-journey-by-jo-ivester><a aria-label="Anchor link for: never-a-girl-always-a-boy-a-family-memoir-of-a-transgender-journey-by-jo-ivester" class="header-anchor no-hover-padding" href=#never-a-girl-always-a-boy-a-family-memoir-of-a-transgender-journey-by-jo-ivester><span aria-hidden=true class=link-icon></span></a> <em>Never a Girl, Always a Boy: A Family Memoir of a Transgender Journey</em> by Jo Ivester</h1><p>9/10. This was an interesting read. There is a lot about the trans experience I would like to understand, so I'm glad I got to read Jeremy Ivester's story of transition. This is a collection of scenes told from the points of view of different members of the Ivester family as Jeremy (nÃ©e Emily) grew up and reckoned with his gender dysphoria, eventually coming to live as a man.<p>The last section of the book does seem a little self-congratulatory on account of the author's deep dive into her activism, and earlier segments in the book give the impression that the mother (who collected and wrote this memoir) really just wanted to process her thoughts in a book. I knocked a point off for those writing choices.<h1 id=the-dispatcher-by-john-scalzi><a aria-label="Anchor link for: the-dispatcher-by-john-scalzi" class="header-anchor no-hover-padding" href=#the-dispatcher-by-john-scalzi><span aria-hidden=true class=link-icon></span></a> <em>The Dispatcher</em> by John Scalzi</h1><p>8/10. This was a short one, but an interesting concept. Definitely worth the two hour listen. The writing was a little unpolished in places, and there were some big questions left unanswered, but overall it was an enjoyable scifi story.<h1 id=the-nazis-by-lauence-rees><a aria-label="Anchor link for: the-nazis-by-lauence-rees" class="header-anchor no-hover-padding" href=#the-nazis-by-lauence-rees><span aria-hidden=true class=link-icon></span></a> <em>The Nazis</em> by Lauence Rees</h1><p>I picked this book up in November. Something about that current events made me want to research the rise of the Nazi regime, I forget specifically what.... Imagine my grimly brief shock to learn that many associated with the Nazi party still to this day (or at least the day of Rees interviewing them) stand by their actions as seeming to be the right thing at the time. Yep.<p>This was a fairly good account of the rise of Nazism in Germany, followed by a decent account of WWII as related to the Third Reich, followed by a bizarre tangent into the Soviet experience of WWII, and concluded with more Nazi history.<p>8/10 for the lengthy diversion into Soviet history.<h1 id=change-how-to-make-big-things-happen-by-damon-centola><a aria-label="Anchor link for: change-how-to-make-big-things-happen-by-damon-centola" class="header-anchor no-hover-padding" href=#change-how-to-make-big-things-happen-by-damon-centola><span aria-hidden=true class=link-icon></span></a> <em>Change: How to Make Big Things Happen</em> by Damon Centola</h1><p>10/10. This is a great book on how challenging ideas spread through a social network. It was eye-opening, fascinating, and full of research that challenged my preconceived notions, most of which was done by the author. I highly recommend anyone who wishes to know more about how change happens in a people, how and why some ideas take hold and others don't, read this book front to back.<h1 id=beyond-lies-the-wub><a aria-label="Anchor link for: beyond-lies-the-wub" class="header-anchor no-hover-padding" href=#beyond-lies-the-wub><span aria-hidden=true class=link-icon></span></a> <em>Beyond Lies the Wub</em></h1><p>7/10. An okay short story.<h1 id=pigs-is-pigs><a aria-label="Anchor link for: pigs-is-pigs" class="header-anchor no-hover-padding" href=#pigs-is-pigs><span aria-hidden=true class=link-icon></span></a> <em>Pigs is Pigs</em></h1><p>10/10. Hilarious satire. A worthwhile short story if there ever was one.<h1 id=verification-handbook-ed-craig-silverman><a aria-label="Anchor link for: verification-handbook-ed-craig-silverman" class="header-anchor no-hover-padding" href=#verification-handbook-ed-craig-silverman><span aria-hidden=true class=link-icon></span></a> <em>Verification Handbook</em> ed. Craig Silverman</h1><p>This book explains a lot.<p>It is meant as a handbook to educate journalists on best practices for verifying sources, especially as an emergency breaks. It is filled with such mind-numbingly basic advice on verifying information on social media that I wish I hadn't spent the time to read it. Advice like, "Cultivate a network of trustworthy people" and "Verify facts with a quick Google search before spreading them" is like giving someone pointers on brushing their teeth like, "If your toothbrush ends up buried four inches up your nostril, you're doing it wrong."<p>If this is the state of the art of verifying sources, it is no wonder journalists are so often bamboozled, misinformed, and outright deceived with frightening regularity. 2/10.<h1 id=harry-potter-and-the-deathly-hallows-by-j-k-rowling><a aria-label="Anchor link for: harry-potter-and-the-deathly-hallows-by-j-k-rowling" class="header-anchor no-hover-padding" href=#harry-potter-and-the-deathly-hallows-by-j-k-rowling><span aria-hidden=true class=link-icon></span></a> <em>Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows</em> by J.K. Rowling</h1><p>I believe I reread this early in the year, when my wife and I were playing Hogwarts Legacy around the clock. It was a wonderful, heart wrenching jaunt into one of my favorite childhood series.<h1 id=eleanor-oliphant-is-completely-fine-by-gail-honeyman><a aria-label="Anchor link for: eleanor-oliphant-is-completely-fine-by-gail-honeyman" class="header-anchor no-hover-padding" href=#eleanor-oliphant-is-completely-fine-by-gail-honeyman><span aria-hidden=true class=link-icon></span></a> <em>Eleanor Oliphant is Completely Fine</em> by Gail Honeyman</h1><p>10/10. One of my favorite books of the year. The unreliable narrator, the Classics minor, the despair which then has delightful developments at the start. This is easily one of my Top Books of 2024.<h1 id=focus-by-daniel-goleman><a aria-label="Anchor link for: focus-by-daniel-goleman" class="header-anchor no-hover-padding" href=#focus-by-daniel-goleman><span aria-hidden=true class=link-icon></span></a> <em>Focus</em> by Daniel Goleman</h1><p>I don't remember much about this book. That says a lot about its content, eh? I do recall that a nontrivial amount of its content seemed obvious or repetitive.<h1 id=atomic-habits-by-james-clear><a aria-label="Anchor link for: atomic-habits-by-james-clear" class="header-anchor no-hover-padding" href=#atomic-habits-by-james-clear><span aria-hidden=true class=link-icon></span></a> <em>Atomic Habits</em> by James Clear</h1><p>I believe this was lampooned on the <a href=https://www.patreon.com/IfBooksPod rel=noopener target=_blank>If Books Could Kill</a> podcast (which I highly recommend). The book itself had some interesting ideas, like deconstructing the habits you want to acquire and incorporating those smaller steps into your life instead of the whole habit all at once. By and large, however, <em>Atomic Habits</em>, as with most self-improvement books, could have been reduced to a blog post. Clear drones on and on, flailing to flesh out the one or two things he has to say into a work long enough to publish as a book.<p>3/10. Not really worth the read, but if you're bored at your grandparents' house....<h1 id=paved-paradise-by-henry-grabar><a aria-label="Anchor link for: paved-paradise-by-henry-grabar" class="header-anchor no-hover-padding" href=#paved-paradise-by-henry-grabar><span aria-hidden=true class=link-icon></span></a> <em>Paved Paradise</em> by Henry Grabar</h1><p>10/10. An Important Book to Read. Grabar goes into detail about how parking requirements are at the heart of a whole slew of urban ills plaguing America: suburban sprawl, lack of public transportation, traffic congestion, unwalkable communities. This is a must-read for anyone interested in any of those issues.<h1 id=the-age-of-surveillance-capitalism-by-shoshana-zuboff><a aria-label="Anchor link for: the-age-of-surveillance-capitalism-by-shoshana-zuboff" class="header-anchor no-hover-padding" href=#the-age-of-surveillance-capitalism-by-shoshana-zuboff><span aria-hidden=true class=link-icon></span></a> <em>The Age of Surveillance Capitalism</em> by Shoshana Zuboff</h1><p>8/10. This book really does drone on, and arguably should be a lot shorter, but its content is so important that I can't in good conscience knock it below an 8/10. Shoshana, who, I believe, coined the term <em>Surveillance Capitalism</em>, details the lengths to which Big Tech companies mine us for the newest exploitable resource: our behavioral data. I wish all could come up to date with this topic, as data collection is so pervasive, and those who are least educated on it are exploited the most.</section></article></main><span class=hidden id=copy-success> Copied! </span><span class=hidden id=copy-init> Copy code to clipboard </span><script defer src=https://tristanandrus.com/js/copyCodeToClipboard.min.js></script></div><footer><section><nav class="socials nav-navs"><ul><li><a class="nav-links no-hover-padding social" href=https://tristanandrus.com/atom.xml rel=noopener target=_blank> <img alt=feed loading=lazy src=https://tristanandrus.com/social_icons/rss.svg title=feed> </a><li><a class="nav-links no-hover-padding social" rel="noopener me" href=https://github.com/steelswords/ target=_blank> <img alt=github loading=lazy src=https://tristanandrus.com/social_icons/github.svg title=github> </a><li><a class="nav-links no-hover-padding social" rel="noopener me" href=https://www.linkedin.com/in/tristan-andrus target=_blank> <img alt=linkedin loading=lazy src=https://tristanandrus.com/social_icons/linkedin.svg title=linkedin> </a><li><a class="nav-links no-hover-padding social" rel="noopener me" href=https://fosstodon.org/@steelswords target=_blank> <img alt=mastodon loading=lazy src=https://tristanandrus.com/social_icons/mastodon.svg title=mastodon> </a><li><a class="nav-links no-hover-padding social" rel="noopener me" href=https://bsky.app/profile/steelswords.bsky.social target=_blank> <img alt=bluesky loading=lazy src=https://tristanandrus.com/social_icons/bluesky.svg title=bluesky> </a></ul></nav><nav class=nav-navs></nav><div class=credits><small> Powered by <a href=https://www.getzola.org rel=noopener target=_blank>Zola</a> & <a href=https://github.com/welpo/tabi rel=noopener target=_blank>tabi</a> </small></div></section></footer>
