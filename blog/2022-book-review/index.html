Every chapter laid out truths about software development that resonated deeply with my experience. There were some surreal parts of some of the later chapters where Brooks would go from a timeless nugget of wisdom to discussing details of the microfiche system he was using. However, Iâ€™d say 93% of the book is just as relevant today as it was then. For a 1975 computer book, The Mythical Man Month holds up impressively well.<h1 id=dune-by-frank-herbert><a aria-label="Anchor link for: dune-by-frank-herbert" class="header-anchor no-hover-padding" href=#dune-by-frank-herbert><span aria-hidden=true class=link-icon></span></a> <em>Dune</em> by Frank Herbert</h1><p>7/10. Iâ€™ll admit, I started reading Dune because of the 2021 film. I started reading it in that year and only in 2022 did I finish it. This book is dense. The world building is impeccable. It can be a little tedious at times because you get to experience scenes through multiple charactersâ€™ eyes. I want to know whatâ€™s going to happen to Muadâ€™Dib, but for now this series is on the back burner.<h1 id=ready-player-two-by-ernest-cline><a aria-label="Anchor link for: ready-player-two-by-ernest-cline" class="header-anchor no-hover-padding" href=#ready-player-two-by-ernest-cline><span aria-hidden=true class=link-icon></span></a> <em>Ready Player Two</em> by Ernest Cline</h1><p>3/10. Iâ€™m sad to say this did not live to its predecessor. I think itâ€™s a combination of factors. Most of the references did not resonate with me, and the pacing was wonky. The setup was cool, but took a long time. Then the first couple adventures took a long time, followed by several rushed ones and a quick ending.<h1 id=the-green-mile-by-stephen-king><a aria-label="Anchor link for: the-green-mile-by-stephen-king" class="header-anchor no-hover-padding" href=#the-green-mile-by-stephen-king><span aria-hidden=true class=link-icon></span></a> <em>The Green Mile</em> by Stephen King</h1><p>7/10. Good writing. Mostly interesting story. Not as captivating as Misery. There were some dull spots. But it did make me cry, so thereâ€™s that.<h1 id=shady-characters-by-keith-houston><a aria-label="Anchor link for: shady-characters-by-keith-houston" class="header-anchor no-hover-padding" href=#shady-characters-by-keith-houston><span aria-hidden=true class=link-icon></span></a> <em>Shady Characters</em> by Keith Houston</h1><p>9/10. I would recommend this book to anyone who has ever wondered why the question mark looks the way it does, or anyone who knows what a pilcrow is. Very informative and well researched.<h1 id=evicted-by-nathan-desmond><a aria-label="Anchor link for: evicted-by-nathan-desmond" class="header-anchor no-hover-padding" href=#evicted-by-nathan-desmond><span aria-hidden=true class=link-icon></span></a> <em>Evicted</em> by Nathan Desmond</h1><p>10/10. It is hard to express how meaningful this book was to read. It takes a very honest look at poverty in America, revolving around evictions and housing insecurity. This was written by a man who has spent years with poor tenants and their landlords. This is one of those books that will change your outlook on things forever. I very much recommend it.<h1 id=the-body-a-guide-for-occupants-by-bill-bryson><a aria-label="Anchor link for: the-body-a-guide-for-occupants-by-bill-bryson" class="header-anchor no-hover-padding" href=#the-body-a-guide-for-occupants-by-bill-bryson><span aria-hidden=true class=link-icon></span></a> <em>The Body: A Guide for Occupants</em> by Bill Bryson</h1><p>7/10. This book was good, but felt a little offbeat at times. My main takeaways are these. First, medicine has really only had a handful of really big hits: germ theory, a scientific understanding of anatomy, antibiotics, anesthetic, and vaccines. There is still a lot we donâ€™t know about the body. But olâ€™ Bill Bryson does not have a medical degree, so if anyone qualified would like to email me to correct my takeaways, I would welcome it.<p>The other takeaway from The Body is an understanding of why traditional, conservative farming communities are predisposed to be leery of doctors. Because until about 120 years ago, a lot of what doctors did was actively harmful. Yikes!<h1 id=how-to-invent-everything-a-survival-guide-for-the-stranded-time-traveler-by-ryan-north><a aria-label="Anchor link for: how-to-invent-everything-a-survival-guide-for-the-stranded-time-traveler-by-ryan-north" class="header-anchor no-hover-padding" href=#how-to-invent-everything-a-survival-guide-for-the-stranded-time-traveler-by-ryan-north><span aria-hidden=true class=link-icon></span></a> <em>How to Invent Everything: A Survival Guide for the Stranded Time Traveler</em> by Ryan North</h1><p>10/10. I love this book. I have always tried to build a library where if it were the last remaining library on Earth, I could feasibly rebuild civilization. You know, at least a bit. This book is now the crown jewel of that collection. It was amazing to see how to bootstrap civilization in one hardcover tome. If I ever have to dash off into the wilderness, I hope to have a copy of How to Invent Everything with me.</section></article></main><span class=hidden id=copy-success> Copied! </span><span class=hidden id=copy-init> Copy code to clipboard </span><script defer src=https://tristanandrus.com/js/copyCodeToClipboard.min.js></script></div><footer><section><nav class="socials nav-navs"><ul><li><a class="nav-links no-hover-padding social" href=https://tristanandrus.com/atom.xml rel=noopener target=_blank> <img alt=feed loading=lazy src=https://tristanandrus.com/social_icons/rss.svg title=feed> </a><li><a class="nav-links no-hover-padding social" rel="noopener me" href=https://github.com/steelswords/ target=_blank> <img alt=github loading=lazy src=https://tristanandrus.com/social_icons/github.svg title=github> </a><li><a class="nav-links no-hover-padding social" rel="noopener me" href=https://www.linkedin.com/in/tristan-andrus target=_blank> <img alt=linkedin loading=lazy src=https://tristanandrus.com/social_icons/linkedin.svg title=linkedin> </a><li><a class="nav-links no-hover-padding social" rel="noopener me" href=https://fosstodon.org/@steelswords target=_blank> <img alt=mastodon loading=lazy src=https://tristanandrus.com/social_icons/mastodon.svg title=mastodon> </a><li><a class="nav-links no-hover-padding social" rel="noopener me" href=https://bsky.app/profile/steelswords.bsky.social target=_blank> <img alt=bluesky loading=lazy src=https://tristanandrus.com/social_icons/bluesky.svg title=bluesky> </a></ul></nav><nav class=nav-navs></nav><div class=credits><small> Powered by <a href=https://www.getzola.org rel=noopener target=_blank>Zola</a> & <a href=https://github.com/welpo/tabi rel=noopener target=_blank>tabi</a> </small></div></section></footer>
