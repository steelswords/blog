# Waxing Philosophical

In the beginning of my engineering career (the first couple years of school, for instance), I found tutorials to be really useful in helping me acquire the basics of a skill or concept. Now, though, I find them far less helpful than the official documentation if the product is well-documented. Tutorials often go out of date and pass out of usefulness. Even worse, if a tutorial is really popular, it might still be at the top of your search results, even if its information is horribly obsolete. Documentation of good projects is updated with the software, so it stays useful.

Tutorials also, while fast and easy to digest, too often leave the reader with only a superficial understanding of the framework or library discussed. Concept tutorials are better, since concepts lend themselves more easily to chunk-sized distribution. But trying to document an entire software product with only tutorials ultimately does the serious student a disservice.

So write tutorials at all? They give the reader a broad overview of the software at hand. And a working knowledge of the big picture is vital when swimming through pages and pages of documentation. It’s nice to have a field guide along with the encyclopedia. This is why I still skim tutorials on occasion today. Sometimes the comprehensive sources prove not so comprehensive, and I’d like to read how to do something “quick and dirty,” or to see if an uncommon path is achievable.

I have another reason for writing software tutorials. It’s a little method for learning called the Feynman technique. I’ve used this technique myself since before I even knew it had a name. It is summed up by the phrase, “The best way to learn is to teach.”

I write tutorials because in explaining to others I explain to myself. I write the guide I wish I had read. And by so doing, I find key gaps in my understanding and fix them. I condense and distill until I have mastery. It’s a wonderful system altogether.

I know that as time goes on, my tutorials will get bit rot and fall into uselessness. But I hope for a time they may light some poor student’s way to achieve their goals. And I know they will help me solidify the things I’m working on. So for that reason, I say _Allons-y_!
